## First prototype of the reindeer model

After encountering some [problems](https://solid-late.github.io/3dmodel/2018/04/22/Proto-problem-and-design.html) 
that kept us from finishing our prototype last week, we finally managed to build our first one! We started by cutting the shape of the reindeer out with the lasercutter.

Then we glued all pieces together to check if our prototype was big enough to fit all the electronics in. It turned out that the size was sufficient. We still had some problems with building the prototype, because the super glue didn't stick very well to the material. Fixating it with some tape helped a little bit, but it was still not working well. The final gadged will have all sides covered.
