The given example for FabLab was to build an alarm clock with some additional functions. Our first draft was based on the keywords **furniture**, **wood** and **LEDs** and we figured out shortly that our priority will be focused more on the lights than the clock-idea. When we arrange the lights like in the draft we would be free to use the arduino to programm some clock or different projection using the LEDs.

To seperate the LEDs we would use a fence or similar structure. To make them softer and more equally scattered a not completly transparent paper would be used. At least the LEDs don't get warm.

A light-sensor would adjust the brighteness and maybe colors of the LEDs. Like the projection of the clock we would be quite free about which sensors we want to use (light, humidity, noise, ...).

We needed to integrate some rotation part and we come up with the idea of a circle.

### We stumbled over following problems:
- difficult assemlby
- metal axis-bearing
- electricity, means we need a battery
- disassembly reversible
- moving parts?
