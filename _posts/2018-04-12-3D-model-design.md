Our aim was to give our product a reindeer shaped geometry. 
As we agreed on using wood as the material of the product the manufacturing method is going to be laser cutting of wooden sheets. 
This method sets some limitations on the geometry as it is only able to cut 2D drawings out of sheets, so the 3D model is going to be 
realized by the extrusion of a 2D sketch. 

The 3D model has to fit three main requirements: 

-	has to fit all the electronical components
-	has to be stable
-	has to have a part which is able to rotate

For the modeling process we use Autodesk Fusion 360. The 2D sketch was made according to this picture:

The 2D sketch:

The extruded 3D model:

The electronical components will fit in the body of the reindeer. The LED components have to be visible, so holes are made on the front 
surface of the model where we can place them later. The  model has three legs which is essential for stability. If necessary stability can 
be increased by inserting some metal weights inside the legs. The overall dimensions of the model: 38x45x10 cm.

## Next tasks

This model is not the final geometry of the product. First the prototype is going to be manufactured according to this model, so we can 
decide if the size of the model is right or not. Furthermore the model should be separated into two parts to make it able to perform 
movements. The rotating part will be the head of the reindeer and the axis of the movement will be the axis of the neck. Further 
modifications might be performed on the allocation of the LED components on the front surface.
